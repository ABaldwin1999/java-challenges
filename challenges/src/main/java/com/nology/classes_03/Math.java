 * This is a skeleton of a class you will have to complete it by following these steps.
 * - Adding data fields / properties
 * - Implement getters and setters
 * - Implementing three methods
 *
 * Each step is documented through the class.

    // --------------- Foundation ---------------

    // Create a class of Math to replace the inbuilt static java method with one property called PI...
    // It should contain four methods called....
    // pow - raises the first number to the power of the second e.g. pow(2, 3) = 8
    // min - takes two numbers and returns the smallest
    // max - takes two numbers and returns the largest
    // round - takes one number and rounds it up to the next int
